### This is an assembler and simulator for the Little Minion Computer and Little Man Computer.
The [Little Minion Computer](https://mjrbordewich.webspace.durham.ac.uk/lmc/) model was created by [Professor Magnus Bordewich](https://mjrbordewich.webspace.durham.ac.uk/) of [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/homepage/), based on the [Little Man Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer) created by [Dr. Stuart Madnick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Madnick) of [M.I.T.](https://www.mit.edu/) in 1965.

### It supports the assembly in both specifications.
